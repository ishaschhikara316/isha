            <h3>🔍 The "Why": From Wet Lab to Data Science</h3>
            <p>In my thesis (<a href="#" onclick="openBlog('crispr'); return false;">CRISPR-Cas9 Genome Editing</a>), I explored how to target hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). But identifying a target in the lab is only half the battle. We need to know: <strong>does this gene actually matter in real patients?</strong></p>
            
            <p>To answer this, I stepped out of the wet lab and into bioinformatics. I performed a Survival Analysis using clinical and genomic data sourced from <strong>cBioPortal</strong>, specifically utilizing the <strong>Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas)</strong> dataset to see if <em>HIF1A</em> expression levels correlate with patient outcomes.</p>

            <h3>📊 What is Kaplan-Meier Analysis?</h3>
            <p>Imagine you have two groups of patients. You want to know which group lives longer. You can't just average their lifespans because some patients are still alive (censored data). Kaplan-Meier is the statistical standard for handling this "time-to-event" data.</p>
            
            <p>It calculates the probability of survival at any given time point. It drops the probability curve every time an "event" (death) occurs.</p>

            <h3>📈 Result 1: The "Story" Plot</h3>
            <p>First, I created a visualization designed for quick understanding. This plot divides patients into "High" vs "Low" gene expression groups.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red Line (Risk Group):</strong> Patients with HIGH levels of the gene.</li>
                <li><strong>Blue Line (Safer Group):</strong> Patients with LOW levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong> The blue line stays higher for longer. This suggests that keeping this gene's levels <em>low</em> is better for survival—validating it as a potential target for downregulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🔬 Result 2: The Academic Standard</h3>
            <p>For scientific rigor, I generated a standard publication-quality plot including confidence intervals (shaded areas) and the Log-rank test p-value.</p>
            
            <img src="Image/HIF1A_Academic_Survival.png" alt="Academic Survival Plot" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
            
            <p><strong>Statistical Significance:</strong> The p-value is <strong>0.0549</strong>. Our result is on the borderline—a strong "biological signal" suggesting that with a larger patient cohort, this would likely be definitive. It strongly supports the hypothesis that <em>HIF1A</em> drives poor outcomes in Liver Cancer.</p>

            <h3>💻 The Tech Stack & Data Source</h3>
            <p>This analysis was performed using a custom Python pipeline:</p>
